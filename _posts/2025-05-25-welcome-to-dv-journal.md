Hi there 👋 — and welcome to *DV Journal*! I’m a design verification (DV) engineer currently working at Microsoft, and after spending the last five years in the trenches of silicon bring-up, SoC-level simulations, and UVM testbench chaos, I decided it’s time to write.

### 🧠 Why this blog?

Like many engineers, I learned a lot the hard way — through trial, error, and the occasional 3 a.m. debug session. Over the years, I’ve often found myself wishing for more real-world, post-tapeout insights from folks in the field — not just textbook definitions or outdated examples.

This blog is my attempt to share:

Practical techniques that have worked for me

Debugging stories (and what I learned from them)

Opinions on tools, testbench architecture, coverage closure, and more

Tips for early-career DV engineers navigating complex systems

🧩 A little about me
I started my DV journey 5 years ago . My background spans both ASIC- and SoC-level verification, with exposure to performance verification, QoS logic, memory subsystems, and verification IP reuse across tapeouts.

I’ve seen just how different real DV looks compared to what’s taught in a course or online tutorial — and I want to bridge that gap.

🔍 What I’ll write about
Here’s a sample of what you can expect:

SystemVerilog & UVM best practices

How to structure large, scalable testbenches

Regression infrastructure and coverage closure

Hardware architecture deep dives

Mistakes I’ve made and what they taught me

🚀 Who is this blog for?
If you’re a:

New DV engineer trying to get up to speed

Mid-level engineer looking for new techniques or mental models

Software person trying to make sense of silicon test infrastructure

Or just someone who geeks out over verification challenges

— then I think you’ll enjoy what’s coming.


Until then — thanks for reading, and welcome to DV Journal. I’m glad you’re here.
